**A Minimal CSS UI Kit/Framework For Designers**

With the advent of popular frameworks such as Twitter Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation, developer efficiency increased greatly.
At the same time, however, websites have started following cookie-cutter type patterns, and the only way to let some unique creativity shine through is
creating your own stylesheet. During this process, one often has to override a large amount of styles, so why not just get the parts of the UI needed and reduce the amount of overrides you do?

some.css is a UI Kit/Framework based on the premise that you should only include code that you will use; it has been split up into multiple UI Kits
based on objects and can be used as one unified framework if necessary.
